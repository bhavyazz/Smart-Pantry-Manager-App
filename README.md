## An intelligent Android app to track pantry items, reduce food waste, and provide recipe suggestions based on available items.

## 📌 Abstract

Food waste is a growing global issue, often due to forgotten expiry dates, duplicate grocery purchases, and poor pantry visibility.

SmartPantry Manager solves this by providing:

- 📦 Smart inventory tracking  
- ⏰ Expiry prediction using AI  
- 🔔 Real-time alerts  
- 📱 Voice input via Google Voice API  
- 🛒 Shopping list management  
- 🍲 Recipe suggestions with cooking instructions  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Collaborative pantry access through family management

By analyzing storage conditions (room temperature, fridge, freezer) and produce stages (raw, ripe, overripe), it estimates shelf life accurately, helping users prioritize usage and avoid spoilage.
